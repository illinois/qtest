function bayes_dat=bayes_factor_draw_and_test(m,A,B,N_actual,rstate)
%bayes_factor_draw_and_test computes the Bayes factor using the draw-and-test method
%   BAYES_DAT=bayes_factor_draw_and_test(M,A,B,N,RSTATE)
%   
%   M is the data matrix, where each row gives the outcome of a binomial
%   test. For example, for a 3-dimensional case, with 20 observations per
%   dimensions, M could be [8,12; 7,13; 11,9]
%
%   A and B are the inequalities that define the polytope, i.e. Ax<=B. Note
%   that this method assumes full-dimensional polytopes so no equalities
%   are allowed.
%
%   N is the number of samples used to perform the Bayesian test.
%
%   RSTATE is optional. If specified, the random number generators will
%   be set to the given value (a scalar non-negative integer). This can
%   be used to create repeatable results.
%
% Outputs:
%
%   BAYES_DAT is the Bayes factor computed with volume method.
%   Caution: must not be used for non-full-rank models!
