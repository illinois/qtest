# QTEST

QTEST is a custom-designed public-domain statistical analysis package for order-constrained inference.

## Overview

The goal of QTEST is to make modeling and quantitative testing accessible to behavioral decision researchers interested in substantive questions. We provide a novel, rigorous, yet very general, quantitative diagnostic framework for testing theories of binary choice. This permits the nontechnical scholar to proceed far beyond traditionally rather superficial methods of analysis, and it permits the quantitatively savvy scholar to triage theoretical proposals before investing effort into complex and specialized quantitative analyses. Our theoretical framework links static algebraic decision theory with observed variability in behavioral binary choice data.

## Software

We provide installation for Mac OS (Intel-based) and Windows. We also provide the QTEST source code for users who would like to use the functions directly in Matlab. Please note that this download is data intensive and benefits from a fast internet pipeline. Your machine will need approximately 2GB of storage to complete the installation process.

Unfortunately, our software is not currently compatible with newer Macs that have M1 chips or later. We will be providing a version compatible with newer Macs soon.

## Requirements for Source Code

To use the QTEST source code directly in MATLAB:

1. A valid MATLAB license is required
2. The MATLAB Optimization Toolbox must be installed

## Download

You can download the latest version of QTEST from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/illinois/qtest/releases).
